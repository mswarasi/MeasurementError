# MeasurementError

Measurement error commonly occurs in epidemiological applications when measuring individual covariates. When a regression model is estimated without adjusting for such errors, estimates of the regression coefficients can be severely biased. This repository provides R code and examples pertaining to a new estimation technique that adjusts for covariate measurement error where the response variable is binary pooled response.
